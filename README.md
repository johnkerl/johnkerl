Hello! See my [resumé](http://johnkerl.org/kerl-resume.pdf) for more about my on-the-job work. What you'll see here at GitHub is primarily things I’ve written for myself:

* my development toolkit (such as interlaced [scripts](https://github.com/johnkerl/scripts) and [dotfiles](https://github.com/johnkerl/dotfiles));
* some mathematical projects from graduate school (such as [iff2](https://github.com/johnkerl/iff2), [ruffl](https://github.com/johnkerl/ruffl), and [sack](https://github.com/johnkerl/sack));
* a few things I’ve done just for the fun of it (such as [minecurser](https://github.com/johnkerl/minecurser), [rube](https://github.com/johnkerl/rube), [uno-runner](https://github.com/johnkerl/uno-runner), and [pangram-checker](https://github.com/johnkerl/pangram-checker));
* [Miller](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller) which is my most fulfilling open-source work by far.

Languages in these repos include C, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, Bash, Go, PHP, and JavaScript, with a tiny dab of ancient LISP.

My main open-source priority at the moment is maintaining [Miller](https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
