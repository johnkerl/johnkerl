Hello! See my [resumé](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnkerl/) for more about my on-the-job work. What you'll see here at GitHub is primarily things I’ve written for myself:

* my development toolkit (such as interlaced [scripts](https://github.com/johnkerl/scripts) and [dotfiles](https://github.com/johnkerl/dotfiles));
* a few things I’ve done just for the fun of it (such as [word-finder](https://github.com/johnkerl/word-finder), [pangram-checker](https://github.com/johnkerl/pangram-checker), [Sliver](https://github.com/johnkerl/sliver), [minecurser](https://github.com/johnkerl/minecurser), [rube](https://github.com/johnkerl/rube), and [uno-runner](https://github.com/johnkerl/uno-runner));
* some mathematical projects from graduate school (such as [iff2](https://github.com/johnkerl/iff2), [spffl](https://github.com/johnkerl/spffl), [ruffl](https://github.com/johnkerl/ruffl), and [sack](https://github.com/johnkerl/sack));
* [Miller](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller) which is my most fulfilling open-source work by far.

Languages in these repos include Python, JavaScript, Go, C++, C, Bash, Java, Ruby, Perl, and PHP, with a tiny dab of ancient LISP.

My main open-source priority at the moment is maintaining [Miller](https://miller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
